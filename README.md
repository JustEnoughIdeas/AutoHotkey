Controls:

F - start clicking;

G - stop clicking;

Home - Suspend Toggle (When you try to write something in the game chat or if there is some action on the G or F button in the game, the script will run, but the action in the game will not happen, so this mode can make it so that if you press Home, then you can press G and F freely and the script is not activated);

Delete - Close App;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to change control then you can change " F:: " to any button you want to press to activate script, for example I want to active script on button "A" not on "F" so I change " F:: " to " A:: ", same with " G:: " and " Home:: ".

If you don't know want you're doing, I recommend to always have a reserve copy of the original script to recover it when something gone wrong.
